	ObservationStatusPreliminary ObservationStatus = "preliminary"
	// The observation is complete and there are no further actions needed. Additional information such "released", "signed", etc. would be represented using [Provenance](provenance.html) which provides not only the act but also the actors and dates and other related data. These act states would be associated with an observation status of `preliminary` until they are all completed and then a status of `final` would be applied.

	// Subsequent to being Final, the observation has been modified subsequent.  This includes updates/new information and corrections.

	// The observation is unavailable because the measurement was not started or not completed (also sometimes called "aborted").
	ObservationStatusCancelled ObservationStatus = "cancelled"
	// The observation has been withdrawn following previous final release.  This electronic record should never have existed, though it is possible that real-world decisions were based on it. (If real-world activity has occurred, the status should be "cancelled" rather than "entered-in-error".).

	// The authoring/source system does not know which of the status values currently applies for this observation. Note: This concept is not to be used for "other" - one of the listed statuses is presumed to apply, but the authoring/source system does not know which.
