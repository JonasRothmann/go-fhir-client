	// Contract is activated for period stipulated when both the Grantor and Grantee have signed it. Usage: Required state for normal completion of contracting activity.  Precedence Order = 6. Comparable FHIR and v.3 status codes: accepted; completed.
	ContractResourceStatusCodesExecuted ContractResourceStatusCodes = "executed"
	// Contract execution is suspended while either or both the Grantor and Grantee propose and consider new or revised contract provisions.

Usage: Optional contract activity between executable and executed state. Precedence Order = 4. Comparable FHIR and v.3 status codes: in progress; review; held.
	ContractResourceStatusCodesNegotiable ContractResourceStatusCodes = "negotiable"
	// Contract is a proposal by either the Grantor or the Grantee. Aka - A Contract hard copy or electronic 'template', 'form' or 'application'. E.g., health insurance application; consent directive form. Usage: Beginning of contract negotiation, which may have been completed as a precondition because used for 0..* contracts.

	// Contract template is available as the basis for an application or offer by the Grantor or Grantee. E.g., health insurance policy; consent directive policy.

	ContractResourceStatusCodesRevoked ContractResourceStatusCodes = "revoked"
	// Contract is reactivated after being pended because of faulty execution. *E.g., competency of the signer(s), or where the policy is substantially different from and did not accompany the application/form so that the applicant could not compare them. Aka - ''reactivated''. Usage: Optional stage where a pended contract is reactivated. Precedence Order = 8. Comparable FHIR and v.3 status codes: reactivated.
	ContractResourceStatusCodesResolved ContractResourceStatusCodes = "resolved"
	// Contract reaches its expiry date. It might or might not be renewed or renegotiated. Usage: Normal end of contract period. Precedence Order = 12. Comparable FHIR and v.3 status codes: Obsoleted.
