	// Linear regression is an approach for modeling two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variables. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression)  This Statistic code will return both a gradient and an intercept value.
