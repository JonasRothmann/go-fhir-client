	// i) Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug intake; ii) Could also be explained by disease or other drugs; or iii) Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.
	AdverseEventCausalityAssessmentPossible AdverseEventCausalityAssessment = "possible"
	// i) Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug intake that makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible); or ii) Disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations.
	AdverseEventCausalityAssessmentUnlikely AdverseEventCausalityAssessment = "unlikely"

	AdverseEventCausalityAssessmentConditionalClassified AdverseEventCausalityAssessment = "conditional-classified"
	// i) Report suggesting an adverse reaction; ii) Cannot be judged because information is insufficient or contradictory; or iii) Data cannot be supplemented or verified.
